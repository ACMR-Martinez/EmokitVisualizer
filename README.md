# EmokitVisualizer

This is an Open Source signal visualizer project for the Emotiv EPOC+ Dongle based on the open source project [Emokit](https://github.com/openyou/emokit)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

First, if you are in a Windows machine, you should install the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python
It depends on the version of Python of your preference, for example, here is the [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266) for Python 2.7


### Installing


After you have installed the Visual C++ Compiler, you have to start a cmd console in the folder that holds your project and type:

```
pip install - r requirements.txt 
```

This command will install all the Python modules needed for running the Emokit driver package
